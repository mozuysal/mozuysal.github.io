        <p>I'm a Computer Vision Researcher with expertise in geometric computer
          vision and probabilistic machine learning. I earned my PhD
          at <a href="https://cvlab.epfl.ch">CVLAB</a>, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch">EPFL</a>,
          co-founded two startups, and served in an academic role at
          the <a href="https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr">Computer Engineering
          Department</a>
          of <a href="https://www.iyte.edu.tr">IYTE</a>. Currently, I am
          a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at the <a href="https://hubx.co/ailab">HubX AILab</a>.</p>
        
        <p>I love programming to address real-world challenges, which often
          boils down to the optimization of a suitable parametric model to
          discover a nice local minimum of a probabilistic cost function that
          approximates what the real-world does with an acceptable error
          margin.</p>

        <p>Recently, I have done some work on
            optimizing <a href="https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux">Flux</a>
            to run at top speed on A100 GPUs
            and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-sixth-generation-tpu-is-in-preview">Trillium</a>
            TPUs on GCP.</p>
